Machine Learning Level 1 Final Project: Cinematic Preferences Survey and Comparative Analysis

I am pleased to present my final project for the Level 1 Machine Learning course, a comprehensive exploration into cinematic preferences through a survey. This project delves into the fascinating intersection of individual preferences and various influencing factors.

Project Overview:
Objective: To understand and analyze participants' cinematic preferences and correlate them with different factors.

Methodology:

Conducted a survey gathering data on participants' movie preferences, considering genres, directors, and other relevant aspects.
Collected additional information, such as demographic details, to explore correlations with cinematic tastes.
Key Features:

Data Collection: Gathered a diverse dataset encompassing a wide range of cinematic tastes and participant demographics.
Preprocessing: Cleaned and organized the data to ensure accuracy and reliability in subsequent analyses.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized statistical and visualization techniques to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented machine learning models to predict cinematic preferences based on identified factors.
Results:
Genre Preferences: Identified prevalent genre preferences among participants, revealing insights into popular cinematic tastes.

Demographic Correlations: Explored how factors like age, gender, and location correlate with specific movie preferences.

Predictive Models: Developed machine learning models that successfully predicted participants' movie preferences based on the gathered data.

Conclusion:
This project not only allowed me to apply foundational machine learning concepts but also provided valuable insights into the complex interplay between individual preferences and external factors. The knowledge gained from this project lays a solid foundation for future endeavors in the field of machine learning and data analysis.

I am excited about the possibilities for further refinement and expansion of this project and look forward to delving deeper into the intricate world of machine learning in future coursework and projects.
